# This App Thingy 🤪
Ok so like this app is made for putting chat widgets inside other websites and stuff.

## What It Do?

- Visitors come in, maybe say hi or stay sneaky anonymous
- Visitors make pending convos like “hey I wanna talk”
- Users (the admin types) grab those pending convos and make real convos happen
- People talk in convos with messages, yay!
- Projects are there too but like not really explained here lol

## Tech Stuff (I Guess)

- Python, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy — the fancy backend thingies
- PostgreSQL or whatever your database is
- Async stuff to make things fast
- WebSockets to annoy people with instant messages
- Some cookies or tokens for keeping track of who’s who

## What’s Missing?

- Maybe a front end? I hope you know how to make one
- Tests? Nope, just vibes
- Docs? Yeah no, this readme is it

## How To Run?

Just run it. Like:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
